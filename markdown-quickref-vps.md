## Headings

Headings are used to create titles and subtitles. Markdown supports six levels of headings. We use as many (but upto six) hash' ( `#` ) followed by a space followed by text to create that level of header.

***Syntax***
```md
# This is header level 1 or H1
```

***Renders as***
# This is header level 1 or H1

<br>

***Syntax***
```md
## This is header level 2 or H2
```

***Renders as***
## This is header level 2 or H2

<br>

***Syntax***
```md
### This is header level 3 or H3
```

***Renders as***
### This is header level 3 or H3

and so on..

## Text Formatting or Emphasis

Text Formatting or Emphasis is used to italicize or bold or strikethrough the text. We can use asterisks ( `*` ) or underscores ( `_` ) for italics or bold text and tilde's ( `~` ) for strikethrough. I have used ( `*` ) for bold and itlics in examples below, you can try them using ( `_` ) instead.

### Italic 
Put the text between a pair of one asterisk ( `* * ` )

***Syntax***
```md
*this is italicized text*
```

***Renders as***
*this is italicized text*

<br>

### Bold
Put the text between a pair of two asterisks ( `** ** ` )

***Syntax***
```md
**this is bold text**
```

***Renders as***
**this is bold text**

<br>

### Itlicized Bold
Put the text between a pair of three asterisks ( `*** *** ` )

***Syntax***
```md
***this is itlicized bold text***
```

***Renders as***
***this is itlicized bold text***

<br>

### Strikethrough 
Put the text between a pair of a tilde's ( `~~  ~~` )

***Syntax***
```md
~~this is strikethrough text~~
```

***Renders as***
~~this is strikethrough text~~

## Paragraphs and Line Breaks











## Horizontal Seperator

Horizontal rules are used to separate content. We can create a horizontal rule by using three or more hyphens ( `-` ), asterisks ( `*` ), or underscores ( `_` ) on a line. I have demonstrated below example using hyphens ( `-` ), you can try with others.

```md
---
```
